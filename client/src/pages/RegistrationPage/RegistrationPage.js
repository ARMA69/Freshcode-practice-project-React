            <div className={styles.article}>
              You always have an option of hiring a consultant or coming up with
              the name
              yourself.
              However, Squadhelp builds great brands that succeed faster by
              connecting you with
              the
              most creative people across the globe. Most importantly, Squadhelp
              provides you with
              choice: you get to see ideas from dozens (in some cases, hundreds)
              of contestants
              before
              you select a winner. Typically, you would spend far less money
              with Squadhelp
              (our contests start at $199) than hiring an agency. Also, you will
              receive immediate
              results - most contests begin receiving submissions within minutes
              of starting.
